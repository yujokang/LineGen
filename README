Line Generator

This project includes two header files, line_gen.h and c_gen.h,
and will build an archive, line_gen.a, to help format lines written to a file.
It keeps track of the indentation depth, up to a desired limit,
and automatically applies the indentation when writing on a new line.

Building and Installing:
You need the contents of the "include" folder
in your project's include directory, and link to the "line_gen.a" archive.
The former comes with the source code,
and the latter will appear in the root of the source directory
after you run "make".

When compiled out of the box, the library code is not optimized,
and includes debug information and output.
To remove debug output, remove "#define DEBUG" from the top of "src/c_gen.c".
To remove debug information from the binary, remove "-g" from "_CPPFLAGS"
in "common.mk".
In "common.mk", you can also modify "_CPPFLAGS" to add optimization,
and change "CC" to any GCC-compatible compiler.

Creating and using "struct line_gen":
line_gen.h defines "struct line_gen" and short helper functions for using it.
If you already have a file output stream (of type "FILE *"),
you can initialize the struct using "init_line_gen".
If you only know the path to the file, you can use "open_line_gen",
and when you no longer need the struct, you can close it,
including the stream, using "close_line_gen".
The file contains functions for indenting and unindenting,
and writing raw text, similar to fwrite, and writing formatted text,
similar to fprintf, albeit with indentation at the beginning of each line.

Creating and using "struct c_gen":
c_gen.h defines "struct c_gen",
which has a field, "base_gen", of type "struct line_gen",
for which the functions in line_gen.h can be used.
"init_c_gen" is thus a wrapper around "init_line_gen",
with a maximum indentation depth of 10,
and likewise, "open_c_gen" and "close_c_gen" are analogues to
"open_line_gen" and "close_line_gen", respectively.
This header file defines a number of helper functions for
generating C-style statements and blocks, and declares "declare_function",
which is defined in src/c_gen.c, and thus requires linking to line_gen.a.
